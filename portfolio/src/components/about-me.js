            My name is Joshua Rinehart, and this is a little bit about me! I'm an aspiring web designer soon armed with a certificate from 2University and The Ohio State University. In addition to web development, I am also creating designs for a clothing brand that a friend and I are aiming to launch.

            Maybe add some more later?
